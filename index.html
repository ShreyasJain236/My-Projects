          <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam (1931–2015),</b> known as the "Missile Man of
            India," was a visionary scientist, educator, and the 11th President
            of India. Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, to a humble family, he
            rose to prominence through his contributions to India’s space and
            defense programs, playing a key role in the development of the
            SLV-III, Agni and Prithvi missiles, and the Pokhran-II nuclear
            tests. A passionate advocate for education and youth empowerment, he
            envisioned a developed India through advancements in technology and
            rural progress, as outlined in his book "India 2020". Renowned for
            his humility and simplicity, Kalam inspired millions with his belief
            in dreaming big and working tirelessly. He passed away on July 27,
            2015, while addressing students, leaving behind a legacy of
            innovation, inspiration, and patriotism.
